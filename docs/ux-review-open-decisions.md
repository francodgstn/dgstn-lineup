# Open decisions — parked for Franco

Questions raised while working the UX review that need a product call rather than a
code judgement. Recorded here as they arise so the autonomous run does not stall
and does not guess. Each entry states what was done in the meantime, so nothing is
blocked waiting for an answer.

Status legend: **PARKED** (needs a decision) · **ASSUMED** (proceeded on a stated
assumption, reversible) · **ANSWERED** (decided; kept for the record).

## 1. Promo codes on memberships — deferred, not refused
**ANSWERED 2026-08-17.** UX-25 shipped an intro offer owned by the PLAN (first N
periods). Promo codes on memberships stay deferred: a promo is a Stage A modifier
inside `resolvePaymentOptions`, which returns ONE amount, while a recurring discount
is a schedule. Revisit only if studios ask for a *code* rather than a standing offer.

## 2. Weekly-report distortion if a stage backfill is ever run
**PARKED.** UX-83 makes `trial_* → joined` write a conversion row. A backfill of
already-stranded contacts would dump months of historical conversions into ONE
week's `trial_conversions_count` (`trackContacts` stamps the current week).
*Meanwhile:* nothing was backfilled — pre-launch, no production tenants, and no
seeder writes `signup_completed_at`. **Decide before the first real migration**, not
before launch.

## 3. `hmd-fighting-cup` and other tenant-specific plugins
**PARKED, low priority.** Noticed while auditing plugin teardown (UX-16). A
customer-specific plugin sits in the generic catalogue. Not a defect; a product
question about what belongs in a white-label catalogue.
